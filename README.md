# FFCOtoMeOS
FFCOtoMeos is a Java program allowing you to convert the FFCO (French federation of orienteering race) CSV member list file into XML files, usable my MeOS.


Two XML files are generated :
- One containing the clubs;
- Another containing the competitors


They respond to the IOF-XML normalisation (http://www.orienteering.org/datastandard/IOF.xsd)
